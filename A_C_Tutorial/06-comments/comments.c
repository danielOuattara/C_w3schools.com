Comments in C
===================

Comments can be used to explain code, and to make it more readable.
It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.

Comments can be singled-lined or multi-lined.

Single-line Comments
--------------------

Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).

Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by the compiler
(will not be executed).

This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code:

// printf("Hello World!");

This example uses a single-line comment at the end of a line of code:

printf("Hello World!"); // This is a comment


Multi-line Comments
------------------------
Multi-line comments start with  \/* and ends with *\/

Any text between and  those \/* and *\\
will be ignored by the compiler :

The code below will print the words Hello World!
    to the screen, and it is amazing *\/
// printf("Hello World!");


Single or multi - line comments ?
----------------------------------

It is up to you which you want to use.Normally,
we use // for short comments, and \/* *\/ for longer.

Good to know : Before version  C99(released in 1999),
    you could only use multi - line comments in C. */
